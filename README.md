# My Blog

This is the Github repo for my blog, which can be seen here: [http://blog.mstoiber.com](http://blog.mstoiber.com) 
I am currently working on a redesign without using a theme, you can find the Github repo for that [right here](https://github.com/mstoiber/poole).

## Lanyon

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
